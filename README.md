## Description

pybrev is a small script I wrote to help me come up with good abbreviations for software I write. A lot of the prototypes and demos I produce in connection with my research will need some snazzy name that encompasses all features of its contents. This script helps with that.

## Usage

```
./pybrev.py <list of keywords separated by whitespace>
```

Example:
```
./pybrev.py implementation concept higher order brain processes
```

## More?

I'll gladly take suggestions, but keep in mind this is a quick 'n dirty thing. I'll expand as necessary.

## Known issues

A lot of perfectly normal combinations might not show up as expected. This may be due to missing some digraphs or blends that would be fine to introduce.
